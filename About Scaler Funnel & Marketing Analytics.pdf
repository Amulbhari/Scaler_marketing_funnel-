Scaler Funnel & Marketing Analytics Dashboard
Why I Built This

I created this dashboard to demonstrate how data analytics can drive smarter marketing decisions—something that’s at the heart of what Scaler does. As someone who’s genuinely interested in real-time marketing performance, I wanted to simulate how Scaler might track user behavior across key touchpoints like Meta and Google Ads.

What It Shows

The Funnel in Action: From ad impressions to clicks, signups, demo bookings, and ultimately paid users—this funnel view helps identify where users are dropping off.

Channel-Level Insights: Metrics like ROAS, CTR, CVR, and CAC are broken down by marketing channel, helping pinpoint what’s working and what’s not.

Budget Decisions Made Easier: The dashboard provides clear signals on where to double down and where to pull back.

Interactive Views: With drilldowns into user journeys and trendlines over time, it’s built for teams that want to explore, not just observe.

This project mirrors the kind of work I’d love to do as a Data Analytics Intern at Scaler—bringing clarity to data, turning insights into action, and helping scale growth efficiently.
